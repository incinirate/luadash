* _.reduceWithIndex(array, iteratee, zero)

  Reduce all of the elements in 'array' to a single
  value by successively applying 'iteratee' to each
  element, its index, and the accumulator, starting
  from 'zero'.

  Example:

    > _.reduceWithIndex({ 1, 2, 3 },
      function(acc, i, v)
        return acc + i * v
      end, 0)
    => 14
